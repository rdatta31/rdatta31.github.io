			<h1>Radiatively-Cooled Magnetic Reconnection</h1>
			
			<p>Reconnection occurs in a radiatively-cooled regime in many astrophysical plasmas, such as black hole accretion disks and their coronae, pulsar magnetospheres, and gamma-ray bursts.
			Our experiments on the Z Machine were the first to access a regime that shows both plasmoid formation and strong cooling. 
			X-ray and visible spectroscopy, X-ray imaging, X-ray diodes and inductive probes were used to characterize the experiments, which were supplemented with 
			three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the experiment. </p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
			
			<h1>Measuring Adibatic Index and Mach No. in Magnetized Oblique Shocks</h1>
			<p>The adibatic index determines the amount of compression that shocks can generate, which is important in inertial and magneto-inertial confinement fusion.
			This project, awarded the ZNetUS-2024 grant, aims to measure the adibatic index in magnetized plasmas. <p>
			
			
		</div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
			
			<h1>Magnetized High-Energy-Density Bow Shocks</h1>
			
			<p>Magnetized shocks occur in both inertial confinement fusion plasmas, and in astrophysical systems.
			Our experiments show anisotropy in the shock structure, with a larger opening angle in the plane parallel to the magnetic field.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class="main"><p><b>Computation and Numerical Modeling</b><p></div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
			
			<h1>Resistive Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</h1>
			
			<p>We run resitive MHD simulations using GORGON to model a variety of physics,
			 including radiative-cooling and guide field effect in reconnection expeirments, planar wire arrays, and bow shocks.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
			
			<h1>Radiation Transport Modeling</h1>
			
			<p>Radiation transport modeling is necessary for interpreting visible or X-ray spectrosocpy data. 
			Our radiation transport solver, which uses emissivity and opacity data computed using PrismSPECT or SCRAM, can be used to generate synthetci spectroscopic data.  </p>
			
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="main"><p><b>Plasma Diagnostics, Optimization, and Machine Learning</b><p></div>

		
		<div class = "Project1">
			
			<h1>Spectroscopy Analysis using Machine Learning</h1>
			
			<p>Spectroscopy analysis can be time-consuming and computationally expensive for large datasets.
			Using machine learning, we can significanly reduce the time required to analyze spectroscopy data with a loss in accuracy.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
			
			<h1>Tomographic Reconstruction in Pulsed-Power Plasmas</h1>
			
			<p>Commonly-used plasma diagnostics, such as interferometry or laser imaging, provide line-integrated views of the plasma along limited lines of sight.
			Using tomography, we can reconstruct the 3D structure of reconnection layers, z-pinches, and shocks.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		
		
		<div class = "Project1">
		
		<h1>Shock-based Diagnostic of Velocity and Temperature in Supersonic Plasmas</h1>
			
			<p>We show that through simultaneous bow shock imaging and inductive probe measurements, velocity and temperature of the
			 plasma can be measured using a cheap easy-to-implement diagnostic.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class="main"><p><b>Photonics and Optical Modeling</b><p></div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
		
		<h1>Optical Modeling of Tunable Optical Plasma Metamaterials</h1>
			
			<p>The properties of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas can be used to design tunable metamaterials,
			 such as plasma lenses, polarizers, and waveguides. We explore this using ray-tracing and Fourier optics. </p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
		<h1>Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on Anisotropic Interfaces   </h1>
		
		<p>Surface plasmon polaritons, which emerge from the oscillation of surface plasma in metals, propagate at interfaces between media,
		 typically between a metal and a dielectric medium. SPPs excited on metal-anisotropic dielectric surfaces can have potential applications in the areas of anisotropic and angle
dependent sensing, tunable surface plasmon resonance, and directional SPP or signalexcitation and propagation. This project explores anisotropic SPPs using theoretical and FDTD simulations in Lumerical.
 </p>
		
		</div>
		
		<div class = "Project1">
		<h1>Photonic band gaps in periodic double-negative multilayer structures   </h1>
		
		<p>Negative index materials can be used to create tunable photonic band gaps that are robust to randomness and defects.
 </p>
