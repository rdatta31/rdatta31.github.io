			<h1>Radiative Cooling in Magnetic Reconnection</h1>
			
			<p>Reconnection occurs in a radiatively cooled regime in many astrophysical plasmas, such as in the solar coronal, black hole accretion disks and their coronae, pulsar magnetospheres, and gamma-ray bursts.
			Our experiments on the Z Machine were the first to access a regime that shows plasmoid formation and strong radiative cooling. 
			X-ray and visible spectroscopy, X-ray imaging, X-ray diodes and inductive probes were used to characterize the experiments, which were supplemented with 
			three-dimensional radiative resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

			<h1>Magnetized Shocks in High Energy Density Plasmas</h1>
			<p> Magnetized shocks occur in both inertial confinement fusion plasmas, and in astrophysical systems, where they drive compression and heating.
			My experiments characterize the structure of bow shocks and oblique shocks in high Mach number plasma flows.

		<h1>Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on Anisotropic Interfaces   </h1>
		
		<p>Surface plasmon polaritons, which emerge from the oscillation of surface plasma in metals, propagate at interfaces between media,
		 typically between a metal and a dielectric medium. SPPs excited on metal-anisotropic dielectric surfaces can have potential applications in the areas of anisotropic and angle
dependent sensing, tunable surface plasmon resonance, and directional SPP or signalexcitation and propagation. This project explores anisotropic SPPs using theoretical and FDTD simulations in Lumerical.
